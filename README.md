## Kobo Markup Extractor

This small CLI tool extracts annotations from your ebooks in a Kobo device including the 
handwritten ones done with the Kobo stylus (or any other stylus)

I created it so I could get my handwritten annotations and highlights from my Kobo Libra Colour.

### Features
**Extract Handwritten annotations:**
* Generate images with your handwriting overlayed in the book page
* Order all the annotations by appearence in the book
* Bundle all images into a single PDF
* Delete the temporary images (although you can keep them using the `--keep` flag)

**Extract highlihts**:
* Extract all your highlights, including the color
* Bundle them into a TXT file formatted in HTML to paste in other tools (e.g. Logseq, Obsidian)

#### Not supported (yet)
* Notes support: If you added notes with the keyboard into a highlights, they are not extracted
* PDF books: The only way for now is to manually export the PDF to your computer.
